FINISH Cyber Tileset






- when holding alt you can drag around the canvas

try adding a 0.1 opac fill to canvas box place, uses custom color

sometimes checkbox can be checked but volumes dont show????????????? *very rare*



fix when clicking on object container colors dont update



IDK

x box place removing always shows small box at box place start, weird


New Feature Ideas

per object start delay, would need a new tile sheet for 1-15, empty for random
<Objects sheet="Objects" seed="3">0</Objects>
