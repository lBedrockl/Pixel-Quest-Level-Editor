FINISH Cyber Tileset


import to clipboard once copy all works

canvas scrolling and no limit
for scroll just add an offset to viewed tiles
ctrl + scroll for scrolling




- when holding alt you can drag around the canvas

try adding a 0.1 opac fill to canvas box place, uses custom color

sometimes checkbox can be checked but volumes dont show????????????? *very rare*



fix when clicking on object container colors dont update



IDK

x box place removing always shows small box at box place start, weird
